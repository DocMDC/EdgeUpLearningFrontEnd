# AI Qbank 

The basic idea of this application is a tool that helps medical students test themselves on complex topics as they prepare for the board exams. It’s essentially a question bank. As a medical doctor (M.D.) who started an education company many years ago, I always wanted to hire software developers to build a question bank for my company but it was too costly at the time. Then I discovered how much I enjoyed coding and decided to tackle the project myself. This project is the culmination of years of dedicated learning.

Once you register, you can login and see the full project. As a user, you can create an exam from a list of pre-made questions. You can filter the questions based on subject, determine how many questions you want in your exam, and have the exam be timed, untimed, tutored, or untutored. Once you enter an exam, a new interface will open up. Here, you can see a list of questions and you’ll have access to many features such as AI chat, creating a unique note for the question, a calculator, dark mode, etc. One aspect of the project I am proud of is the integration with Open AI’s API and prompt engineering which gives the AI context about each exam question.

I built both the front end and back end using multiple technologies including React, Tailwind, Redux, RTK query, NodeJS, Express, and MongoDB. 

There are many highlights to mention including the use of custom React hooks, React browser router, React context, user authentication, role-based authorization, utilization of cookies and JSON web tokens, and integration with external APIs (Open AI). 

Most of all, I am proud to say after years of dedication as a self-taught developer I have built something on my own that solves a unique problem, and that has caused me to grow in ways that would not have been possible without the countless hours spent on this project. I hope you enjoy browsing through the application and viewing the source code.
